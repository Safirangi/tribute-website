  <p id="tribute-info">Nikola Tesla (July 10, 1856–January 7, 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and futurist. As the holder of nearly 300 patents, Tesla is best known for his role in developing the modern three-phase alternating current (AC) electric power supply system and for his invention of the Tesla coil, an early advancement in the field of radio transmission.</p>
 <br>
<p>During the 1880s, Tesla and Thomas Edison, inventor and champion of direct electrical current (DC), would become embattled in the “War of the Currents” over whether Tesla’s AC or Edison’s DC would become the standard current used in long-distance transmission of electrical power.</p>
  
  <h2 id="legacy">LEGACY</h2>
  <p>It is believed that Tesla was granted around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions during his lifetime. While several of his patents remain unaccounted for or archived, he holds at least 278 known patents in 26 countries, mostly in the United States, Britain, and Canada. Tesla never attempted to patent many of his other inventions and ideas.</p>
<br>
<p>Today, Tesla’s legacy can be seen in multiple forms of popular culture, including movies, TV, video games and several genres of science fiction. For example, in the 2006 movie The Prestige, David Bowie portrays Tesla developing an amazing electro-replicating device for a magician. In Disney’s 2015 film Tomorrowland: A World Beyond, Tesla helps Thomas Edison, Gustave Eiffel, and Jules Verne discover a better future in an alternate dimension. And in the 2019 film The Current War, Tesla, played by Nicholas Hoult, squares off with Thomas Edison, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, in a history-based depiction of the war of the currents.</p>
<br> 
<p>In 1917, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal, the most coveted electrical prize in the United States, and in 1975, Tesla was inducted into the Inventor’s Hall of Fame. In 1983, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Tesla. Most recently, in 2003, a group of investors headed by engineer and futurist Elon Musk founded Tesla Motors, a company dedicated to producing the first car fittingly powered totally by Tesla’s obsession—electricity.</p>

<h1>FAMOUS INVENTIONS</h1>
<ul>
  <li><h4>The Tesla Coil</h4>
    <p>It is a transformer used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. To observers, it appears as if lightning is being shot into the air.
A Tesla coil consists of a primary coil and secondary coil, each with its own capacitor to store electrical energy. The two coils and capacitors are connected by a spark gap. A high-voltage source powers the system.<p/>
  </li>
  <li><h4>The Magnifying Transmitter</h4>
  <p>Tesla had intended the Tesla Coil to be part of a wireless power system and was a mainstay of many of Tesla’s other experiments.
By running a wire connected to the resonator around his lab he permeated his lab with electromagnetic energy and was able to light a fluorescent bulb held in his hand because the voltage drop through the air was great enough to cause a sufficient current flow.
Using a  magnifying transmitter, he was also reportedly able to light a field of bulbs at a distance of 1 km. The magnifying transmitter was an adaptation of the Tesla coil, only instead of discharging to the earth, the magnifying transmitter created standing waves of electrical energy, which could be harnessed by a tuned receiving circuit.</p>
  </li>
<li><h4>Tesla Turbine</h4>
<p>Tesla saw the rise of the piston engine in the automobile industry as a way to make a change in the world. He developed his own turbine-style engine that used combustion to make disks rotate.
The fuel efficiency of his engine was as high as 90%, a big achievement considering this is similar to the efficiency of some modern turbines.</p>
  </li>
<li><h4>The Shadowgraph</h4>
<p>While Rontgen has been credited with developing the first X-ray films, called shadowgraphs, there is clear evidence that Tesla was also working in this area. The problem is that Tesla lost a lot of his work due to a fire in his lab.
Tesla may well have produced the first x-ray image in the United States when he attempted to use a vacuum tube to obtain an image of Mark Twain. However, instead of Twain, the resulting image showed the screw for adjusting the camera lens.
He did later obtain shadowgraph images of the human body, shortly after Roentgen published his discovery on November 8, 1895. Tesla also described some clinical benefits of x-rays.</p>
  </li>
<li><h4>Radio</h4>
<p>Before his lab burned down, Tesla discovered that he could use his coils to transmit and receive powerful radio signals, tuning them to resonate at the same frequency. By early 1895, he was ready to transmit a signal 50 miles from his lab, to West Point, New York. But the fire in Tesla's lab destroyed his work. 
While he was rebuilding, a young Italian experimenter named Guglielmo Marconi, who was working in England, took out the first wireless telegraphy patent.
When Marconi later set up long-distance demonstrations, he used a Tesla oscillator to transmit the signals across the English Channel.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Neon Lamp</h4>
<p>Tesla did not invent fluorescent or neon lights, but he did contribute to improving both inventions. He took the lights and created the first neon sign.
At the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, he demonstrated neon light signs and how they can make unique designs and even form words. Thanks to Tesla you can identify your favorite bar.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Niagara Falls Transformer House</h4>
<p>When it came to deciding what company would build a power generator at Niagara Falls, Thomas Edison was the first choice. After reviewing Tesla’s work for Westinghouse Electric, though, the Niagara Falls commission went with Tesla’s alternating current power.
Despite doubts, Tesla’s system worked well and became a standard for hydroelectric power.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Induction Motor</h4>
<p>The first AC commutator-free three-phase induction motor was invented independently by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla. Although Ferraris presented his engine first, in 1885, it was Tesla who filed for a patent first.
George Westinghouse, who was developing an alternating current power system at that time, licensed Tesla's patents in 1888. This type of motor is commonly used in vacuums, blow dryers, and power tools, even today.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Alternating Current</h4>
<p>Alternating current is considered Tesla’s crowning achievement. While not the inventor of AC power, he made it easy to use widespread.
AC power allows for electricity to be sent over long distances much more efficiently. Westinghouse bought Tesla’s AC patents and used them to bid on the lighting of the Chicago World’s Fair.
They won the contract and were able to provide power at around $150,000, which is less than it would have cost to provide power using direct current.</p>
